## Introduction

I shared templates I created. They allow to create a Swift or Objective-C sources with sections. This helps to structure your code. It is then much easier to maintain and evolve your code. When it's possible I insert code snippets to help you.

## Manual Installation 
Open `Terminal.app` and made the following commands:
```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone https://github.com/TofPlay/Tof-Templates.git
$ cd "Tof-Templates/File Templates"
$ mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/
$ cp -R Tof\ Templates ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/
```
