# Tof Templates
Xcode templates for Swift and Objective-C

## Introduction

I shared templates I created. They allow to create a Swift or Objective-C sources with sections. This helps to structure your code. In templates for CocoaTouch are even code snippets to help.

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone https://github.com/TofPlay/Tof-Templates.git
